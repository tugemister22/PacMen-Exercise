# PacMen-Exercise
## Description
This code will cause a Pacman animation to move back and forth to each side of the screen by clicking on the image.

Executing Program
To implement, download files into a single folder on your machine, drag the file titled pacmenindex.html into your browser and click on the image of Pacman.

Roadmap
Future improvements would include a backdrop graphic, similar to the arcade game, for Pacman to move along.
